## About Me

I’m a 4th-year Cybersecurity Engineering student with a focus on network security, intrusion detection, and applied cryptography.  
My passion lies in combining scientific curiosity with practical engineering to create solutions that are both secure and scalable — whether it’s for terrestrial infrastructure, deep-sea systems, or space technologies.

My approach is grounded in hands-on research, cross-disciplinary integration, and a deep respect for protocol-level resilience.
